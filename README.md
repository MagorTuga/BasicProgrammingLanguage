# BasicProgrammingLanguage

Run the 'interpreter.exe' file with any Python terminal of choice.
Visual Studio Code was used for development.
When prompted by the application, type the name of the file you wish to read, for example "file.txt" without the brackets.
Both files need to be in the same directory.
The output should be displayed in the Terminal. If not, an appropriate error message should be displayed in its place.

# This interpreter features:

-A basic calculator, with support for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Numbers are stored as decimal values.

-Boolean Logic, with support for comparisons between numbers, strings and booleans.
Booleans are represented with 'True' and 'False'.
Logical AND is represented with '&' and OR is represented with '|'.

-String operation and comparison.

Priority of operation in order:
```
( )
* /
+ -
!
> >= < <=
== !=
&
|
```

Lines of code must end with a semicolon.

The language does not need to be built.
Python 3.8.10 or higher needs to be installed in order to run the application.
Access to the Python terminal or an IDE with Python support is required.
